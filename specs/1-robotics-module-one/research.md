# Research Plan for Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Phase 0: Research Outline

This document outlines the research tasks required to clarify unknowns identified in the technical context and to establish best practices for content creation and Docusaurus publishing.

### Research Tasks:

1.  **Docusaurus Performance Metrics**:
    *   **Objective**: Identify relevant performance metrics for Docusaurus static sites (e.g., page load times, build times) and establish reasonable targets.
    *   **Context**: The plan currently states "Fast loading Docusaurus site; specific metrics for page load times or build times NEEDS CLARIFICATION."
    *   **Deliverable**: Specific, measurable performance targets for the Docusaurus site.

2.  **Docusaurus Content Validation Best Practices**:
    *   **Objective**: Determine best practices and available tooling (plugins, scripts) for validating Docusaurus content against specified requirements (word count, heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3), meta descriptions (<160 chars)).
    *   **Context**: The plan relies on content validation to meet quality and consistency standards.
    *   **Deliverable**: A recommended set of tools/methods for automated content validation.

3.  **Docusaurus PDF Generation and Citation Embedding**:
    *   **Objective**: Investigate the capabilities of Docusaurus for PDF generation and methods for embedding citations (APA style) within the generated PDF, ensuring traceability and academic rigor.
    *   **Context**: The constitution requires the final paper to be delivered in PDF with proper citations.
    *   **Deliverable**: A clear process or recommended plugin/approach for PDF generation and citation management within Docusaurus.

## Initial Research Questions:

*   What are common performance bottlenecks for Docusaurus sites, and how are they typically measured and optimized?
*   Are there existing Docusaurus plugins or community solutions for enforcing markdown linting rules related to heading structure and word count?
*   What are the options for integrating academic citation management (e.g., BibTeX) with Docusaurus for both web and PDF output?
