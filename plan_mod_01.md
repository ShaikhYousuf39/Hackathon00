Project: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook  
Module: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)  
Tooling: Spec-Kit Plus + Claude Code + Docusaurus

Objective:
Generate a complete production plan for writing Module 1 of the textbook.  
The plan must break down:
- Chapters (4–5 total)
- Lessons (3 per chapter)
- Learning outcomes
- Required diagrams
- Required examples/code
- Dependencies (ROS 2, rclpy, URDF tools)
- Sequence of writing steps
- Review steps (technical accuracy, clarity, SEO, formatting)
- Final assembly instructions for Docusaurus

Plan Requirements:
- Format the plan in clear hierarchical bullet points.
- Ensure alignment with /sp.constitution and /sp.specify.
- Include estimated word count for each part.
- Identify work items for Claude Code (auto-writing) vs manual editing.
- Identify checkpoints for verification (code testing, URDF validation).
- Ensure that the plan guarantees:
  - 100% accuracy
  - Zero plagiarism
  - Smooth Docusaurus publishing

Output Format:
A single, highly structured plan optimized for execution in Spec-Kit Plus.
