Project: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook
Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Objective:
Break the entire Module 1 creation process into clear, actionable, machine-executable tasks.  
Each task must be small, atomic, and verifiable.

Task Requirements:
- Use ultra-clear, stepwise, atomic tasks.
- Every task must have a measurable output.
- Tasks must follow the hierarchy:
  1. Research Tasks
  2. Outline Tasks
  3. Writing Tasks
  4. Code/Diagram Tasks
  5. Review Tasks
  6. Build & Deployment Tasks
- Tasks must align with /sp.constitution, /sp.specify, and /sp.plan.
- Every task must end with a short “Success Condition”.

Tasks:

1. **Research: ROS 2 Fundamentals**
   - Gather authoritative information on Nodes, Topics, Services, Parameters.
   - Success: All facts validated from ROS 2 docs.

2. **Research: rclpy Integration**
   - Study Python agent → ROS controller bridge.
   - Success: Documented examples validated via ROS 2.

3. **Research: URDF for Humanoids**
   - Collect minimal humanoid URDF structures.
   - Success: Verified URDF examples that load without error.

4. **Outline: Module 1 Structure**
   - Create 4–5 chapters with 3 lessons each.
   - Success: Outline matches word-count and hierarchy rules.

5. **Write: Chapter Drafts**
   - Generate each chapter (~500 words) with meta description.
   - Success: All lessons follow H1 → H2 → H3 format.

6. **Write: Lesson Content**
   - Produce concise lessons (~150–180 words each).
   - Success: Lessons are clear, accurate, plagiarism-free.

7. **Write: Code Examples**
   - Create ROS 2, rclpy, and URDF code that runs without modification.
   - Success: Code tested inside ROS 2 environment.

8. **Generate: Diagrams (Mermaid/Markdown)**
   - Diagram middleware flow, nodes graph, and URDF tree.
   - Success: Diagrams render correctly in Docusaurus.

9. **Technical Review**
   - Validate correctness of ROS commands, APIs, and URDF.
   - Success: No hallucinated or incorrect technical details.

10. **SEO Review**
    - Ensure meta descriptions <160 chars.
    - Success: All chapters optimized for search engines.

11. **Format Conversion**
    - Format all content into Docusaurus-compatible Markdown.
    - Success: No formatting or rendering issues.

12. **Build & Deploy**
    - Add module to Docusaurus.
    - Run build → deploy to GitHub Pages.
    - Success: Module 1 appears live without errors.

Output Format:
Return the tasks in a clean bullet list exactly as above with no extra commentary.
