# Chapter 4: Advanced ROS 2 Concepts

This chapter explores advanced ROS 2 concepts that are essential for complex robotic applications. We'll cover parameters for configurable systems, actions for goal-oriented communication, and launch files for managing complex system configurations.

## Overview

As robotic systems become more complex, advanced ROS 2 features become essential for effective system organization and operation. This chapter covers three critical advanced concepts: Parameters for runtime configuration, Actions for long-running goal-oriented tasks, and Launch files for system orchestration.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

1. Use ROS 2 parameters for runtime configurability of nodes
2. Implement action-based communication for complex, long-running tasks
3. Create launch files to manage complex robotic system configurations
4. Apply advanced patterns for system integration and management
5. Optimize system performance using advanced ROS 2 features

## Lessons

This chapter is divided into three lessons:

1. [ROS 2 Parameters](lesson-1) - Understanding and using parameters for configurable nodes
2. [ROS 2 Actions](lesson-2) - Goal-oriented communication with actions
3. [ROS 2 Launch Files](lesson-3) - Managing complex robotic systems with launch files

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this chapter, ensure you have:

- Strong understanding of basic ROS 2 concepts (from Chapter 1)
- Experience with node development
- Knowledge of system integration patterns

Let's begin by exploring the ROS 2 parameter system for configurable nodes.
