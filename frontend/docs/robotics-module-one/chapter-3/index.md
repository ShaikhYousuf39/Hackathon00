# Chapter 3: Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)

This chapter provides a comprehensive understanding of the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF), an XML-based format used to describe robots in ROS. We'll explore the structure of URDF files and how to create effective robot descriptions, with special attention to humanoid applications.

## Overview

URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) defines the physical and kinematic properties of a robot, including its links, joints, and visual/inertial properties. Understanding URDF is essential for simulation, visualization, and control of robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

1. Create comprehensive URDF descriptions for robotic systems
2. Understand the relationship between links, joints, and their properties
3. Apply URDF to model humanoid robots with complex kinematic structures
4. Use tools and techniques for working with and visualizing URDF models
5. Validate and debug URDF files effectively

## Lessons

This chapter is divided into three lessons:

1. [URDF Structure](lesson-1) - Understanding the structure and components of URDF
2. [Humanoid Robotics & URDF](lesson-2) - Applying URDF to model humanoid robots
3. [URDF Tools & Visualization](lesson-3) - Tools and techniques for working with URDF

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this chapter, ensure you have:

- Understanding of basic robotics kinematics
- Familiarity with XML syntax
- Knowledge of ROS 2 concepts (from previous chapters)

Let's start by exploring the fundamental structure of URDF files.
