# Chapter 1: ROS 2 Core Concepts

This chapter introduces the fundamental building blocks of ROS 2, the Robot Operating System version 2. We'll explore the core concepts that form the foundation of robotic applications, including nodes, topics, and services.

## Overview

ROS 2 Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of the ROS 2 architecture. Understanding how they work is crucial for developing distributed robotic systems. We'll also cover the communication patterns that enable nodes to interact with each other effectively.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

1. Understand the role and function of ROS 2 nodes
2. Implement publish-subscribe communication using topics
3. Create request-response communication using services
4. Use ROS 2 command-line tools for introspection
5. Apply best practices for node design and communication

## Lessons

This chapter is divided into three lessons:

1. [ROS 2 Nodes](lesson-1) - Understanding the fundamental building blocks
2. [ROS 2 Topics](lesson-2) - Exploring publish-subscribe communication
3. [ROS 2 Services](lesson-3) - Learning request-response communication

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this chapter, ensure you have:

- A working ROS 2 installation
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of distributed systems concepts (helpful but not required)

Let's start by exploring ROS 2 nodes, the foundational element of any ROS system.
