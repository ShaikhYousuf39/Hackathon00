# Chapter 2: Python & ROS 2 (rclpy)

This chapter explores how to bridge Python-based agents with ROS 2 controllers using rclpy, the Python client library for ROS 2. We'll examine architecture patterns, communication protocols, and implementation strategies for effective integration.

## Overview

The connection between Python agents and ROS controllers involves creating robust communication layers that enable intelligent decision-making to control robotic systems. This chapter covers various approaches from direct integration to external interfaces.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

1. Implement Python agents as ROS nodes using rclpy
2. Create effective bridges between external Python agents and ROS controllers
3. Design communication strategies for agent-controller interaction
4. Apply best practices for performance and reliability
5. Handle real-time constraints in agent-controller systems

## Lessons

This chapter is divided into three lessons:

1. [rclpy Basics](lesson-1) - Introduction to the Python client library for ROS 2
2. [Python Agents & ROS Controllers](lesson-2) - Connecting agents to controllers
3. [Bridging Mechanisms](lesson-3) - Techniques for connecting Python agents to ROS controllers

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this chapter, ensure you have:

- Understanding of ROS 2 core concepts (from Chapter 1)
- Intermediate Python programming skills
- Knowledge of basic control systems concepts

Let's begin by understanding the fundamentals of rclpy.
