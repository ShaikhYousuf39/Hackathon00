# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This module focuses on the middleware for robot control, specifically ROS 2, and provides a comprehensive understanding of how to bridge Python agents with ROS controllers.

## Overview

This module covers the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 as the "nervous system" of robotic systems. You'll learn about:

- Core ROS 2 concepts including Nodes, Topics, and Services
- How to bridge Python agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- The Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) for humanoid robotics
- Advanced ROS 2 concepts including Parameters, Actions, and Launch files

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1. Understand and implement ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services
2. Create Python agents that interact with ROS controllers
3. Design robot models using URDF for humanoid applications
4. Configure complex robotic systems using parameters and launch files
5. Implement action-based communication for goal-oriented tasks

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with robotics concepts
- Understanding of Linux command line (for ROS 2 operations)

## Structure

This module is organized into four chapters, each containing multiple lessons:

- **Chapter 1**: ROS 2 Core Concepts - Understanding the fundamental building blocks
- **Chapter 2**: Python & ROS 2 (rclpy) - Bridging Python agents with ROS controllers
- **Chapter 3**: Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) - Modeling humanoid robots
- **Chapter 4**: Advanced ROS 2 Concepts - Parameters, Actions, and Launch systems
